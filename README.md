# Chaabi Assignment

Given a data source (csv per say), build a Query Engine for English language

Deliverables:
- Implement vector embeddings on the given dataset and store them in a Vector DB like Qdrant.
- Implement an LLM on the DB that can give contextual answers to the queries strictly from the database.
- Wrap this LLM as an API using any framework.
